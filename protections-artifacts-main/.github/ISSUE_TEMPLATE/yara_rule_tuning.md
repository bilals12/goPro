## Description
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the suggested changes including any important details or context why the rule needs to be fixed. Any kind of alert volume within the specific time period and the number of endpoints impacted is super helpful. For example, this YARA rule is hitting on a signed Windows executable (svchost.exe) and has been triggered 200 times in the last 7 days on 5 different endpoints. --->

## Example Sample
<!-- We are happy to look into false positives and rule tunings. In order to do this we need to validate the request with a sample and verify the data along with the rule. Please provide a link to the sample within [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search). If the sample cannot be shared publicly, engage with us on our community Slack or email us directly.  -->
